Shuffling data: generally a good idea with independent samples
  Timeseries: generally don't shuffle, but can use out of sample for test OR multi train/test splits

SVM parameters:
  cost (C): low is less penality of error term (generalizes better), higher C will overfit/stricter - uses more hyperplanes
    - C is 1 by default, consider decreasing it if there's many noisy observations
  gamma: degree of influence of single training example, low is neighborhood, high is far
